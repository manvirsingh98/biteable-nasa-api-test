# Project
I decided to build the project in react framework. I try to use modern best practices of javascript es6.

# Important Note
- Please put your own key in the /src/api/api.js file, there is variable called "apiKey".
- Project is build in React js framework.

# Steps to run project
1. Extract the zip file.
2. Run command "npm install".
3. run command "npm start"
4. Systtem will automatically open localhost:3000 or other available port.

# Steps to play around
1. After running project sucessfully, you will see web page.
2. You need to choose rover from the list and then you need to choose date and then camera (date dropdown will show after rover selection ...)
3. when you select all three fields rover, date, camera, select submit button.
4. you will see all the pictures by camera, date, rover below.

# Time management
    To build this project it tooks approximatly 1 hour and 30 minutes. Most of the time I spend to think about how to make user friendly UI for customer.

# Issue Encountered
 The only issue I faced that, after certain api calls, api stop giving response because of exceed limit api call.

 # changes for PRODUCTION
 1. I want to keep env variables like apiKey or URL in seperate .env file.
 2. I will make common custom select component to use it dyanmically.
 3. I will integrate google analytics to track the traffic.
 4. i will integrate logging system (Sentry etc) to keep track if any error occures

Thank you so much to read above data and Thanks for your valuable time :)
